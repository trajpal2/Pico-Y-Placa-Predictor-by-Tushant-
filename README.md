# Pico-Y-Placa-Predictor-by-Tushant-
This is the pico y placa predictor used for fetching the details of vehicle to check if the car should be on road or not. I have made this Pico y Placa Predictor using the Visual Studio on ASP.NET programming and with the help of Object Oriented Code at the back end.
